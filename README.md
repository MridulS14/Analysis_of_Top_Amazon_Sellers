## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze Amazon sellers in the Garden category and provide data-driven recommendations to the acquisitions team. We used a dataset consisting of various sellers' metrics, including product counts, ratings, and seller performance indicators. 

## Data Cleaning
Using MySQL, the dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis. The following steps were applied:
1. **Duplicate Removal:** Eliminated all duplicate entries to ensure data accuracy.
2. **Data Standardization:** Ensured consistent formatting across key fields like rating percentages, country names, and seller URLs.
3. **Handling Null/Zero Values:** Null values and zero entries were either excluded or replaced with averages based on predefined business rules.
4. **Column Reduction:** Removed unnecessary columns, focusing only on key metrics such as rating counts and seller performance indicators.

## Visualizations
After cleaning the data, we used Power BI for visualization. Key visualizations include:
1. **Pie Chart - Seller Distribution by Country:** Shows geographical distribution of sellers, highlighting countries with the most merchants.
2. **Stacked Column Chart - Hero Product Ratings:** Displays top sellers based on the ratings of their key products.
3. **Bar Chart - Number of Ratings:** Ranks sellers by their overall rating counts.
4. **Bar Chart - Composite Score by Country:** Compares countries based on a calculated composite score.
5. **Treemap - Top Sellers by Composite Score:** Visualizes top sellers, providing insights into their market dominance.
6. **Slicer for Interactive Analysis:** Allows filtering data based on specific countries for a more tailored analysis.

## Metrics and Key Insights
- **Total Sellers Analyzed:** 1,000 sellers.
- **Total Ratings:** 266K ratings.
- **Average Positive Rating:** 84.36%.
- **Average Composite Score:** 137.51.
- **Top Performing Countries:** Germany (314 sellers) and Canada (519 sellers).
- **Top Sellers by Rating Count:** Seller 487 with 37K ratings, indicating strong customer engagement.
- **Top Product Performers:** Sellers 498 and 496 stood out for high hero product ratings.

Composite Score Formula:
```sql
Composite_Score =  
 'cleaned_data'[positive_rating_percentage] * 0.4 +  
 (1 - 'cleaned_data'[Max % of negative seller ratings - last 12 months]) * 0.2 +  
 'cleaned_data'[rating_count] * 0.4
```
